<p>
 In the last few years we were faced with a grave challenge across the world. COVID 19 affected every country, some were prepared, but there are also countries that were not and have faced massive consequences. In this project I have gathered data from various online sources such as Wikipedia, and Wisevoter on each country. I have conducted analysis to see if there are significant difference from the performances of each country depending on their level of development, the Human Development Index. This index measures the country's performance on living standards, health, and education which is consolidated by the United Nations to compute for the index. There are several questions that I wish to be answered in this project which are listed below

<h3>Questions to be asked:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>How many countries are there per continent present in our dataset?</li>
  <li>Which countries have the highest of the three different metrics we have mentioned?</li>
  <li>How is the different Country Development distributed per Continent?</li>
  <li>Which continents have the highest of the three different metrics we have mentioned?</li>
  <li>How many are countries in each of the Country Development?</li>
  <li>Are there any significant difference for the three metrics amongst the different country development levels?</li>
  <li>What were the outliers?</li>
</ol>
